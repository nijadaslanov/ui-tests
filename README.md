Installation
To install and set up the framework, follow these steps:

Install Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 or above.
Install Apache Maven.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run mvn clean install to download dependencies and build the project.

Configuration
The framework provides configuration options for browser and environment settings. Modify the configuration files as needed:

Browser Configuration: Update the browser type and other options in the browser-configuration.properties file.
Environment Configuration: Update the base URL and other environment-specific settings in the environment-configuration.properties file.

Test Structure
The tests in this framework follow the TestNG testing framework structure. Test classes are organized into packages based on functionality or test categories.

The test classes are located in the com.amazon.ui.tests package. Each test class extends a base test class to inherit common setup and teardown steps.

Page Objects

Page objects represent web pages or components and provide methods to interact with the elements on those pages. Page objects are located in the com.amazon.ui.pages package.

To create a new page object:

Create a new Java class in the com.amazon.ui.pages package.
Extend the BasePage or any relevant base page class.
Define element locators as constants using Playwright's locator syntax.
Implement page-specific methods to interact with the elements.

Test Data
Test data can be managed in multiple ways depending on the project requirements. Some common approaches include:

External Test Data Files: Use CSV, Excel, or JSON files to store test data. Implement a data provider to read and provide test data to test methods.
Test Data Objects: Define test data objects as Java classes with fields representing different data points. Create test data instances and use them in test methods.
Ensure that sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, is stored securely and not exposed in the code or version control system.

Running Tests
To run the tests using the framework:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run mvn test to execute the tests.
By default, the tests will run in parallel using multiple threads based on the configuration specified in the testng.xml file.
You can also customize the test execution by specifying different parameters or options. Refer to the TestNG documentation for more information.

Reporting
The framework generates test reports that provide detailed information about the test execution results. After running the tests, the reports can be found in the target/surefire-reports directory.

Open the HTML report file in a web browser to view the test results, including passed, failed, and skipped tests, along with any error messages or stack traces.

Best Practices
When writing tests using this framework, consider following these best practices:

Use the Page Object Model design pattern to separate page elements and actions from the test logic.
Keep test methods small, focused, and independent.
Use assertions to validate expected behavior and outcomes.
Implement meaningful test descriptions and group tests using TestNG annotations.
Use appropriate logging and error handling techniques to enhance test troubleshooting.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using the framework, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

Verify that all dependencies are correctly installed and configured.
Check the browser and environment configurations for any errors or inconsistencies.
Review the test code and ensure it follows the recommended patterns and practices.
Enable logging and check for any error messages or exceptions.
Refer to the Playwright and TestNG documentation for additional help and troubleshooting steps.
